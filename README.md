## Purpose
The goal of this grant is to scale up a prototype Master's and 6th Year program in Digital Teaching and Learning for K6 teachers, and a 6th year certificate (legally non-binding, non-teacher certification) in Computer Science that was developed in a grant previously funded by the State of Connecticut.

These pilot programs will serve as an impetus to propose standards for a secopndary computer science program and an accletrated route to ceritication for two targeted audiences: existing teachers and candidates switching careers.

Once funded this grant will also support the continuos development of programs on Digital Teaching and Learning directed at the K8 level. We believe every child shoudl enter secondary education ready to choose a pathway in computer science. However we also believe that technology is more of a literacy issue that has shaped the way we read, write, and participate. Regardless if a student chooses computer science in their secondary education porgram we belive all students must address how techonology has reshaped all of humnanity regardless of a career path.

We will also develop these programs in conjunction with the schools and teachers we will serve as we increase Connecticut's capacity to ensure all students have access to high quality computer science programs. The grant will cover the cost of four graduate assistants who will work with us to not only develop the program, but they will complete the program, bring lessons to their classrooms, and then help us iterate on the classes and the programs.

Our Digital Teaching and Learning grant will also rely heavily on methods of Open Pedagogy. We will be working in conjuction with Glitch, INC, a collabopartive coding platform, and mouse.org to develop high quality curriculum and tools to aid in computer science instruction. All matierals developed by this grant will be openly licensed for use and remix.

We will also encourage all researchers and research participants to engage in reflective inquiry throughtout the project. Eeveryone will be given a domain and a website. Not only will they be encouraged to release everything openly but students will reflect on their learning out loud.

We will develop an experential program based more in the classroom and community working with students rather than on a college campus learnign to code by copying and pasting. We want out educators to understand children and computer science. Therefore we will design a job embedded program that relies on instensive summer bootcamp classes and then online field based classes during the school year.
