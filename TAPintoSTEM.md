# unrealated idea 

But if we made the 6th year, MA programs as field based as possible this design would work prek-3, 1-6, 7-12 (CT certitification levels).

## Goal:

This grant, when funded, will allow us to pilot and develop interventions for a  multi-tiered approach to tackling the lack of diversity and readiness in STEM fields by providing a pipeline for future STEM educators prepared to teach science, mathematicws, abd computer science. 

We will achieve this goal by using a formative design experiments based on four pedagogical assumptions: 

* **Dual enrollment** in high school classrooms: We believe our cities and countrysides should be our college campuses and the pipeline to affordable STEM degrees begins in high school. In this pilot study students can earn up to nine transfer credits Three in math, three credits for a technology class, and three credits for a science class.

* **Math Achievement:** All participants will receive additional math support. For this pilot study students will utilize and text software. This will provide us tools for scale up studies when student who meet specific benchmarks will be eligible to enroll in a general education math class at SCSU.

* **Personalized STEM Pathway:** In this pilot study we will be developing and piloting two STEM pathways in Science and Technology. This will provide a a curriculum launching point for a scale up grant when Each of the high school participants will choose a path of science, technology, or engineering using an inquiry-driven formative pedagogies to embed the iterative design nature of STEM fields.

* **Domain of One’s Own:** All participants  will be given a website url and server space. They will create a website with a blog  and will document and reflect on their learning from their website. Participants will be building websites and portfolios while also iterating 

## STEM Pedagogies

We believe the common unifying thread in STEM education is a commitment to community inquiry around principles of formative design. Students need to design, iterate, and reflect on learning. To this end, we will utilize a Domain of One’s Own approach where all participants are given a blog.

We also believe STEM education does not exist without experiential learning . During this pilot study we will develop and test pedagogical techniques around two experiences a citizen science experiment during the academic year and a paid high school internship during the summer.

## STEM Pathways

Beyond the common extra support all students receive in mathematics each will choose a STEM Pathway:
* Science- Will collect experimental data in the field and design scientific experiments.
* Technology- Develop the apps for data collection and build communication tools for other students
* Engineering-Choose to build something. Make and print a 3D model, then build the prototype
* Mathematics-Learn a bit of Python and R to analyze open data sets.

In this pilot program we will develop experiential education around biology and technology.

In order to build all these tools, host participant blogs, and classroom websites we will use the collaborative design and coding platform Glitch.
