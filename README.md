## Purpose
The goals of this grant is to develop a Master's and 6th Year program in Digital Teaching and Learning for K6 teachers, and a 6th year certificate (legally non-binding, not a teacher certification) for comoputer science instruction at the 712 level.

We will develop the programs with fully funded research participants currently working in the K12 classroom. Students of the program will serve as graduate research assistance. This will create an opportunity for educators to apply the lessons in the classroom and provide iterative feedback for program evaluation.
